This game initializes with pieces in their starting positions. Players click on their pieces to select them. Valid moves are only highlighted on the board. 
Clicking on a valid square with round white highlights can moves the piece.
Turns it to alternative players.
Moves are stored in history for the memorization of the game and to use the undo feature and learn from mistakes.

Technical Implementation of this Project:
It Used CSS Grid for the chessboard layout and employs event delegation for handling piece movements.
Implemented object-oriented programming with the "ChessGame" class.
DOM manipulation for updating the game state.
Leverage CSS transitions for smooth visual effects and website handling
I've used chess piece images instead of Unicode characters.
